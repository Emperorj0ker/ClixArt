### Welcome to the Unofficial [ROC Online](https://roc.ionsuite.com/) Art Repository!

The goal of this project is to streamline the process for players getting their Heroclix teams on to the [Roll20 vitrual tabletop](https://roll20.net/).

The following items will be provided here:
* Library of Modern Age character tokens, made to be more easily identifiable, even when zoomed out.
* Complete library of cropped ROC Modern Age map images and a backdrop for the arena, ready to drop on the table.
* Tokens for objects and terrain, both standard and special.
* A step-by-step visual guide on getting everything above setup and the basics of using Roll20!
